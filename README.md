Customer sales analysis

The analysis focuses on data exploration, basic customer segmentation, and sales analysis, with an emphasis on clarity and business relevance rather than complex modeling.

Notes

Revenue calculations are based on the final transaction value (calculated_total) to reflect actual customer spend.

Segmentation uses simple, rule-based logic for interpretability and business relevance.

The most recent months of data may be incomplete and are noted as a caveat in the analysis.
